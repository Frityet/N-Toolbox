# GatherButton

An H3VR mod that adds a wristmenu button called "Gather items". When pressed, it will find all (reasonable) objects in the scene a player may want, and gathers them at their position.

If you notice something not gathering, or an odd behavior, ping me on discord @gamernayr. This includes objects you think should gather, that aren't currently.

**Requirements:**
- Deli 0.3+ (https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli/releases)
- Deli.H3VR (https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli.H3VR/releases)
